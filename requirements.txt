# Main dependencies for unified_evaluator.py
# These are the packages needed to run the main orchestrator script

# Core dependencies
pyyaml>=6.0
pandas>=2.0.0
tqdm>=4.65.0

# Note: The actual evaluation tasks require additional dependencies
# that are managed by the conda environments (harness_env and languages_env).
# 
# If you want to run the evaluator without conda, you would need to install
# ALL dependencies from both config/harness_env.yml and config/languages_env.yml

# Instructions on how to set up the conda environment is added to README.md
